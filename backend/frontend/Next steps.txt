Next Steps:

DM Logic:
other person's Profile picture should show where the group chat picture shows
User should see other person's name in the Group title
Add new "about me" header tab that shows your join code and when you joined the app

when rendering:
<UserLabel name={currentChat.isGroup === true? }>

initially (chatRoomProvider.jsx):
otherMember = state variable that is set to be the user that does not have the same Id as you when loading up chat rooms
*try to change this variable every time the current chat changes if isGroup is set to true

No need for the groupOptions tab( or i guess you can just change "leave chat room" to "stop communication")
-Give user a warning asking if they are sure, and letting them know that if they are the last person in the chat, the messages will disappear forever.

Starts with

-user finding someone's joincode
-A dm is created with them as the members


-Added to the list
-When clicked on, it renders:
        1. The other person's name as the title
        2. Their profile
    if isGroup is set to true.

-Use username to differentiate between the users
